# TO-DO-list-Using-C++

Build a simple console-based to-do list  manager that allows users to add, view, and  delete tasks
Task Input: Allow users to input tasks they want to add to the list.
Add Task: Implement a function to add tasks to the list.
View Tasks: Display the list of tasks with their status (completed or
pending).
Mark Task as Completed: Allow users to mark tasks as completed.
Remove Task: Provide an option to remove tasks from the list.

This code implements the task management system with the following features:

Task Input: Users can input tasks they want to add to the list.
Add Task: The addTask function adds tasks to the list.
View Tasks: The viewTasks function displays the list of tasks with their status (completed or pending).
Mark Task as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed using the markTaskAsCompleted function.
Remove Task: Users can remove tasks from the list using the removeTask function.
The program uses a Task struct to represent each task, which has a description and a completed status. The taskList vector stores all the tasks.

The main function provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the task management system.
